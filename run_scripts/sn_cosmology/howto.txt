Three steps to produce the cosmological metric (Metric of Merit or MoM)
a) SN production
b) SN selection
c) Cosmological fits

a) can be performed using the following script: run_script/sim_to_fit/run_sim_to_fit.py
    -> see python run_script/sim_to_fit/run_sim_to_fit.py --help

b) use the script run_scripts/sn_cosmology/sn_selection.py
   -> see python run_scripts/sn_cosmology/sn_selection.py --help

c) the files produced in b) are used as input to perform cosmological fits using the script run_scripts/sn_cosmology/cosmology.py

  -> see python run_scripts/sn_cosmology/cosmology.py --help

d) to make the various cosmological plots, use the script plot_scripts/sn_cosmology/plot_cosmo.py
