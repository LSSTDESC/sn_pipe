Three steps to produce the cosmological metric (Metric of Merit or MoM)
a) SN production
b) SN selection
c) Cosmological fits

a) can be performed using the following script: run_script/sim_to_fit/run_sim_to_fit.py
    -> see python run_script/sim_to_fit/run_sim_to_fit.py --help

b) use the script run_scripts/cosmology/sn_selection.py
   -> see python run_scripts/cosmology/sn_selection.py --help
   or use the script loop_selection.py in run_scripts/sn_cosmology (for DDF)

    example for WFD
    
    python run_scripts/cosmology/sn_selection.py\ 
    --dataDir=../Output_SN_WFD_sigmaInt_0.0_Hounsell\  
    --dbName=baseline_v3.0_10yrs --runType=WFD_spectroz\  
    --fieldType=WFD --nsn_factor=10 --listFields=WFD
    
c) the files produced in b) are used as input to perform cosmological fits using the script run_scripts/cosmology/cosmology.py

  -> see python run_scripts/cosmology/cosmology.py --help

d) to make the various cosmological plots, use the script plot_scripts/cosmology/plot_cosmo.py
