Shifted Bessel transmissions to match Landolt magnitude system.
(see calibration note, N. Reynault, 2005)

 (*) We took Bessel transmissions (divided by lambda 
     with respect to the Bessel (1990) original paper)

 (*) The filters where shifted bluewards by the following amount
     in order to match the Landolt system well. (see the calib note
     in notes/calib for an explanation of the whole schmoll).

        U shift: +76.8 dilatation of 0.93 (+)
        B shift: -41 A
        V shift: -27 A
        R shift: -21 A
        I shift: -25 A

 (+) Using U-B B-V diagram of Landolt stars compared with synthetic ones.
     The filter obtained is thiner than the orginal one by a factor of 0.93
